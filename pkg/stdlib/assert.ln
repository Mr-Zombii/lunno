# Assertion Module for Lunno

# Assert that a condition is true.
#
# If the condition evaluates to true, this function does nothing.
# If the condition evaluates to false, the program aborts with
# an assertion failure.
#
# Assertions are intended for:
#   - internal sanity checks
#   - validating assumptions
#   - testing and debugging
#
# Example:
#   assert(x > 0)
let assert: fn(bool) -> unit =
    fn(cond) ->
        if cond then ()
        else _builtin_panic("assertion failed")
